        <p>The purpose of this project was to build data visualizations using Spotify's API. Users of the website would input an artist they want recommendations for and a popularity level, then the artist's top 10 songs and 100 recommendations would be visualized on a variety of factors. This project would be accomplished through multiple steps.</p>

        <p>First, data would be pulled from Spotify's API and uploaded to an SQLite server. Data would then be read from the SQLite server and passed through a Flask API to gather the data for the visualization website.</p>

        <p>Note: This solution to gather data is not the most efficient, as it would be simpler to run the app and data through Python. However, as this project is a learning exercise, we wanted to utilize our knowledge of SQL databases.</p>
